[ 3 ] this list excludes mass killings and atrocities not explicitly classified as genocides, as well as genocides occurring outside of wartime, human sacrifices, ethnic cleansing operations, and acts of state terrorism or political repression during peacetime.

[ 3 ] this list excludes mass killings and atrocities not explicitly classified as genocides, as well as genocides occurring outside of wartime, human sacrifices, ethnic cleansing operations, and acts of state terrorism or political repression during peacetime.
