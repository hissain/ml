      "Chunk: This list of wars by death toll includes all deaths that are either directly or indirectly caused by war. These numbers include the deaths of military personnel which are the direct results of a battle or other military wartime actions, as well as wartime / war - related deaths of civilians which are often results of war - induced epidemics, famines, genocide, etc. Due to incomplete records, the destruction of evidence, differing methods of counting, and various other reasons, death tolls of wars have often been quite uncertain, and heavily debated. While the definition of war isn't entirely clear - cut, there is a general understanding of what it is. Merriam - Webster defines war as \" a state of usually open and declared armed hostile conflict between states or nations \", Oxford English Dictionary defines war as \" hostile contention by means of armed forces, carried on between nations, states, or rulers, or between parties in the same nation or state ; the employment of armed forces against a foreign power, or against an opposing party in the state \", and Encyclop√¶dia Britannica defines war as \" a conflict between political groups involving hostilities of considerable duration and magnitude \".\n",

These numbers include the deaths of military personnel which are the direct results of a battle or other military wartime actions, as well as wartime / war - related deaths of civilians which are often results of war - induced epidemics, famines, genocide, etc. Due to incomplete records, the destruction of evidence, differing methods of counting, and various other reasons, death tolls of wars have often been quite uncertain, and heavily debated. While the definition of war isn't entirely clear - cut, there is a general understanding of what it is. Merriam - Webster defines war as \" a state of usually open and declared armed hostile conflict between states or nations \", Oxford English Dictionary defines war as \" hostile contention by means of armed forces, carried on between nations, states, or rulers, or between parties in the same nation or state ; the employment of armed forces against a foreign power, or against an opposing party in the state \", and Encyclop√¶dia Britannica defines war as \" a conflict between political groups involving hostilities of considerable duration and magnitude \".\n",

      "Contents List of wars : 1900 ‚Äì 1944 This is a list of wars that began between 1900 and 1944. This period saw the outbreak of World War I ( 1914 ‚Äì 1918 ) and World War II ( 1939 ‚Äì 1945 ), which are among the deadliest conflicts in human history, with many of the world's great powers partaking in total war and some partaking in genocides. Depending on the source consulted, conflict deaths reached an all - time peak in either 1941 or 1942 at 2. 96 ‚Äì 7. 71 million, during the height of the latter conflict. Besides the aforementioned world wars, a number of smaller conflicts also took place. In Africa, conflicts of this era were mostly fought between European colonial forces on one side and native kingdoms and insurgents on the other, though there are exceptions ( e. g. the Italo - Turkish War, as well as intercolonial invasions of German, Italian and Vichy French possessions in the World Wars ). Likewise, Southeast Asia saw a large variety of native rebellions against the American, European and Japanese colonial empires, while also seeing the intercolonial Pacific War.\n",
